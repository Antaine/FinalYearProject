Week 1 - 11/10/2020
We are researching different services to host our servers including Firebase, Azure, AWS, Heroku and Netlify. -A  
I researched AWS and firebase and found while AWS seems to have more features for a small group the costs out weigh the benefits. - A  

I researched Azure and MongoDB vs Firebase and consulted with Antaine with the findings with both of us agreeing Firebase seemed like the best option. - C  
I gave a brief look at which was better for the database as SQL or NoSQL.  The biggest factor on this seemed to be whether or not we will decide on usinng relational querying, this will become more apparent once we get started. - C 

To Do - "Databases:
This week we will be looking into both MongoDB and Firebase then deciding which one would suit our project better.
We will also be looking into whether a SQL or NoSQL type database will be more particle for our project.
Cloud Storage:
The two cloud storage systems will are looking at are AWS(Amazon) and Azure(Microsoft).  We will determine which of these is more to our liking for the project.
We will be setting up our accounts for these applications also."
