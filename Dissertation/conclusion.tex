This project was chosen for the complexity of it's database as well as the new technologies that we got to learn. As we continued our research it became clear to us that not many people had created  the specific type of program we aimed to create. As this was the case documentation on Angular and Firebase together was very scarce and this made us read the documentation and invent our own ways to provide creative solutions to the problems we faced.\\]

The experience we gathered has shown us the importance of planning, and how a small error can greatly slow down development. As well the challenge of having to complete the entire project remotely and not having access to the same resource gave us a great opportunity for independent learning.\\

Though we did not finish all our goals due to time constraints and other deadlines, we did learn a great deal about NoSQL databases, firebase and Cloud Hosting. It was an exciting project as we had the opportunity to build something in an area we had always had a clear interest in. In conclusion this was a great learning experience and though the project was not perfect, we are very proud of it.
