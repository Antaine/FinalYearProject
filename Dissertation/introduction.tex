\section{Web Applications}
A Web Application is an application that is invoked in a browser while accessing the internet.  Web Applications come in a wide range of types from small-scale application that are short lived to large-scale enterprises that are distributed across multiple servers.  Applications that take advantage of a HTML front-end have the benefit of universal cross-platform access. \cite{hadley2006web} HTTP protocols are used to fetch these HTML document resources.
