Databases:
This week we will be looking into both MongoDB and Firebase then deciding which one would suit our project better.

We will also be looking into whether a SQL or NoSQL type database will be more particle for our project.

Cloud Storage:
The two cloud storage systems will are looking at are AWS(Amazon) and Azure(Microsoft).  We will determine which of these is more to our liking for the project.

We will be setting up our accounts for these applications also.
